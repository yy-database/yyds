/// inspected in roughly N / 2560 seconds. A pass that exhausts the budget resumes from its key

/// The sweeper owns one worker thread that calls [`KeyValueExecutor::sweep_expired`] once
/// per `interval`, starting with an immediate first tick so records that elapsed while the
/// node was down are reclaimed at boot. A failed cycle is not fatal: reclamation goes
/// through each shard's durable commit boundary, so a failure can never corrupt a snapshot
/// and the worker simply retries on the next tick. Dropping the sweeper (or calling
/// [`ExpirySweeper::stop`]) signals the worker and joins it.
